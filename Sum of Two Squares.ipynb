    "### Generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the above theorem and identity, we can build a generalized form to determine whether an integer $n$ can be written as a sum of two squares.\n",

    "#### Using Fermat's Theorem\n",
    "Every prime number in the form of $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ can be written as a sum of two squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding Brahmagupta-Fibonacci Identity\n",
    "If $n$ is an integer, where its prime decomposition consists only prime numbers in the form of $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then $n$ can be written as a sum of two squares. This is because if $p_i$ and $p_j$ are two distinct factors of $n$ then we can write $p_i \\cdot p_j$ as a sum of two squares by the identity. This follows in the similar manner until the product forms $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Even Integers\n",
    "Since $2$ can be written as a sum of two squares, i.e. $2 = 1^2 + 1^2$, and any even integer can be written as $n = 2^km$, it follows that $n$ can be expressed as a sum of two squares if and only if $m$ is a sum of two squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Even Powers of Integer\n",
    "If $n$ is can be expressed as an integer to the power of even integer, i.e. $n = m^{2k}$, then $n$ can be expressed as a sum of two squares. This is because we can write $n = 0^2 + (m^k)^2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalized\n",
    "To wrap it all, if each term in the prime decomposition of $n$ can be written as a sum of two squares, that is when:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>$2$ can be written as a sum of two squares (true)</li>\n",
    "    <li>$p^k$, where $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ is prime, can be written as sum of two squares (true)</li>\n",
    "    <li>$q^k$, where $q \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ is prime, can be written as sum of two squares (only when k is even)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "then, $n$ can be expressed as sum of two squares. In conclusion, if the powers of all the prime decomposition of $n$ in the form of $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ is even, then $n$ can be expressed as sum of two squares."
