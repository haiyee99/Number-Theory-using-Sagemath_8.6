    "# Primitive Roots\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Primitive roots of an integer $n$ is defined to be any positive integer, $a$, such that all integers coprime to $n$ is congruent to $a^k$ for some value $k$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1\n",
    "Determine if 2 is a primitive root of 5!\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    \\phi(5) = 4 = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\\\\n",
    "    1 \\equiv 2^4 \\pmod 5\\\\\n",
    "    2 \\equiv 2^1 \\pmod 5\\\\\n",
    "    3 \\equiv 2^3 \\pmod 5\\\\\n",
    "    4 \\equiv 2^2 \\pmod 5\\\\\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "Since all numbers coprime to 5 can be written as $2^k$, we say that 2 is a primitive root of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal Definition\n",
    "Formally, let $Z_n^*$ be the set of all numbers less than and coprime to $n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    Z^*_n = \\{x \\in N : 1 \\leq x \\lt n, (x,n)=1\\}  \n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, $a$ is a primitive root of $n$ if its power generate $Z^*_n$. That is, every element $x \\in Z^*_n$ is congruent to some value $a^k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 1\n",
    "By [unique factorization](https://brilliant.org/wiki/fundamental-theorem-of-arithmetic/) theorem, we can see that $Z^*_n$ is closed under multiplication. That is, if $a, b \\in  Z^*_n$ and $ab \\equiv c \\pmod{n}$ then $c \\in Z^*_n$ must be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any element $x \\in Z^*_n$, consider the sequence of its power:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    \\{1, x, x^2, ...\\} \\pmod{n}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all of the powers are in mod ${n}$, the sequence will repeat eventually. In fact, [Euler's Theorem](https://brilliant.org/wiki/eulers-theorem/) tells us that it repeats with a period of $\\phi(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    a^0 \\equiv a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not every element $a \\pmod{n}$ has a minimum period of $\\phi(n)$ (Refer *). These elements, by definition, are not primitive roots since $|Z^*_n| = \\phi(n)$. Thus, we can say that $a \\pmod{n}$ is a primitive root of $n$ if and only if its period is $\\phi(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 2\n",
    "The primitive roots of $n$ must be coprime to $n$. This is because if the primitive root, $a$, is not coprime to $n$, i.e. $(a,n)\\neq1$, then by [Bezout's Identity](https://brilliant.org/wiki/bezouts-identity/), $a$ has no inverse mod $n$. Formally,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    a \\cdot a^{-1} \\equiv a \\cdot a^{n-1} \\not\\equiv 1 \n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, there exists no value $k$ such that $a^k \\equiv 1$ except for $k = 0$. Hence, $a$ cannot be a primitive roots of $n$ ($a^k$ is not cyclic)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 3\n",
    "By [Euler's Theorem](https://brilliant.org/wiki/eulers-theorem/), we know that\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "and since the elements of $Z^*_n$ are unique, then by [Lagrange Theorem](https://brilliant.org/wiki/lagranges-theorem/), we can say that the valid value of $k$ such that $a^k \\equiv 1$ is when $k$ is in the form of $\\phi(n) / p_i$ where $p_i$ is the prime factor of $\\phi(n)$, and that $a$ has a period of $\\phi(n) / p_i$. (Refer **)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we conclude that if there exists no prime divisors of $\\phi(n)$, i.e. $p_i$, such that  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    a^{\\phi(n) / p_i} \\equiv 1\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "then $a$ is a primitive roots of $n$"
